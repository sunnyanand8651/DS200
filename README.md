# DS200
In this assignment, i've plotted (a) a scatter plot, (b) a bar plot, and (c) a box plot using different datasets from https://data.gov.in<br/>
I'll discuss about the data sources and observations for the plots in below sections.

## Scatter Plot
For the scatter plot, "Trends in World Primary Energy Consumption by Fuel from 2012 to 2018" dataset is used.
