# DS200
In this assignment, i've plotted (a) a scatter plot, (b) a bar plot, and (c) a box plot using different datasets from https://data.gov.in<br/>
I'll discuss about the data sources and observations for the plots in below sections.

## Scatter Plot
For the scatter plot, "Trends in World Primary Energy Consumption by Fuel from 2012 to 2018" dataset is used. The plot depicts the annual worldwide energy consumption through all types of fuel from 2012 to 2018. As the observation suggests, the energy consumption is consistently increasing over the years.<br/>
